SMILE_exercise-Dynamic_Bayesian_Network
=======================================

An exercise about Dynamic Bayesian Network using SMILE library.

SMILE is a reasoning engine for graphical probabilistic model contributed to the community by the Decision Systems Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh and available at http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/

The code is adapted from the code found in Appendix A in the MS thesis [_Modeling physiological processes with dynamic Bayesian networks_](http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/docs/MSc/2006/JorisHulst/thesis.pdf) by Joris Hulst; I adapted the code to work with the [last release](http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/download/smile_linux_x64_gcc_4_4_5.tar.gz) of SMILE because the original code did not compile.
